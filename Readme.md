# Why do the properties of a data-bound control not work correctly until the control is visible?

## Description

I am trying to export the GridControl's content without making it visible. However, I've found out that most properties do not work if the GridControl has never been visible. For example, the DataRowCount property returns 0 even if there are data in the underling datasource. What is the cause of this problem?


## Answer
This problem does not relate to DevExpress controls. .NET data bindings cannot be properly initialized unless a control is visible. You should manually initialize the control's `BindingContext`.

This example demonstrates how to use the `DataRowCount` property even if the Grid Control is not visible.
